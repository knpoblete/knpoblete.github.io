        <h2 > Hello, world!</h2>  
        <p class="bio">
          I'm Kath, a data consultant with over 10 years experience in the analytics field. 
          I have held different titles in the past - Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Visualization Engineer to name some. 
          I enjoy crunching numbers, finding trends and patterns in data, turning raw insights into actionable insights, 
          and presenting these using data storytelling principles. 
          One skill that sets me apart is I combine UI/UX principles to data visualization and data storytelling to make user-centric analyses.
          Apart from data analysis, I enjoy automating workflows and data pipelines. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm also currently enrolled in City St. George's, University of London under the program MSc Human-Computer Interaction Design.
